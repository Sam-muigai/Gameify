## Gameify
This is an android that fetches Games from [freeToGame](https://www.freetogame.com/api-doc) API.It allows one to check the recommendations based on categories.Also allows one to search for games.

## WIP
I am migrating the whole project to KMP. You can switch to kmp-migration branch to follow along with the journey 

## Demo
You can download the application [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MCSa50GRBpQcfnBrr85DLVrz_9R-vkBp/view?usp=sharing).I will upload it to the Play Store later.

## Model-View-ViewModel
MVVM is a software architectural pattern that separates the presentation logic (View) from the business logic (Model) and introduces a middle layer (ViewModel) to mediate communication between them. This design pattern promotes better code organization, testability, and maintainability of Android applications.

## Tech Stack
- The app is entirely written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) - Hilt provides a standard way to use DI in your application by providing containers for every Android class in your project and managing their lifecycles automatically.
- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) - Jetpack Compose is Androidâ€™s modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android. Quickly bring your app to life with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) - A concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
- [Landscapist Image Loader](https://skydoves.github.io/landscapist/coil/imageloader/) - a Jetpack Compose image loading library which fetches and displays network images with Glide, Coil, and Fresco.
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe REST client for Android and Java which aims to make it easier to consume RESTful web services.
- [Kotlin Flows](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) - Aids in handling streams of data asynchronously which is being executed sequentially.
- [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) - a modern JSON library for Android, Java and Kotlin. It makes it easy to parse JSON into Java and Kotlin classes.
- [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) - Timber is a logger with a small, extensible API. It provides utility on top of android's standard Log class.
