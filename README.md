## Model-View-ViewModel
MVVM is a software architectural pattern that separates the presentation logic (View) from the business logic (Model) and introduces a middle layer (ViewModel) to mediate communication between them. This design pattern promotes better code organization, testability, and maintainability of Android applications.
